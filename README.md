## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using the League of Legends API, I created a fetch function that receives information from the API then manipulates the DOM to display the information received. Using different ids within my HTML I was able to input different text through Javascript.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

I learn how to work API's and properly input data into the DOM with the use of Javascript.
